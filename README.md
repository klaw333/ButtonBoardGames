# ButtonBoardGames
This is is a small arcade game I created for my daughters. It consists of 12 arcade buttons with inbuilt LEDs and a Raspberry Pi 4 sandwiched between two pieces of plywood.
One of the buttons is red and is used to start one of three games.

Lightning: Lights up random buttons for the player to press before time runs out. If they misses too many buttons they lose. If they succeed with enough presses they advance to the next level with a higher dificulty.

Memory: Shows a pattern of LEDs, the player needs to repeat the pattern. Each new level adds a new button.

Loop: Cycles the LEDs on the outer ring, the player has to press the red button when it's lit up. Each level gets progressively faster.
